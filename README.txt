GENERAL USAGE NOTES

This compressed folder contains the files necessary to calculate upward convergence trends for the employment rate across the European Union countries building on the methodology developed in  "Eurofound (2018), Upward convergence in the EU: Concepts, measurements and indicators, Publications Office of the European Union, Luxembourg", available at the following link:             
https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/report/2018/upward-convergence-in-the-eu-concepts-measurements-and-indicators

More specifically, the folder contains three different files:
1 STATA .do file (named "Hitchhiker - STATA Toolkit for upward convergence analysis for publication - June 2020") to perform the calculations of convergence based on different measures (sigma, beta and delta) and to investigate Member States dynamics (comparison of Member States trends against the EU average and analysis of the magnitude of convergence trends);
2 STATA .dta file (named "DB.dta") containing the employment data used in the .do file (source: Eurostat lfsa_ergan, from 2002 to 2016);
3 PDF file (named “Hitchhiker@Eurofound End-User Licence Agreement”) containing the end user licence agreement of the .do file.

The tutorial explaining the various steps of the script is available at:

Disclaimer: Research carried out prior to the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union on 31 January 2020, and published subsequently, may include data relating to the 28 EU Member States. Following this date, research only takes into account the 27 EU Member States (EU28 minus the UK), unless specified otherwise. The STATA script computes EU descriptive statistics for EU27. As this script can be used as a template for further analysis, users are invited to adjust countries aggregation as needed.
